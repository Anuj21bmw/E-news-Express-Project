Introduction
A/B testing is a common method used to compare two versions of a webpage or app to determine which one performs better. This project involves analyzing the data from such a test conducted by E-news Express. The analysis will help in making data-driven decisions regarding the platform's features.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform a thorough analysis of the A/B test data to identify whether the changes made to the platform result in a statistically significant improvement in user engagement and conversion metrics.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and hypothesis testing.
scripts/: Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
results/: Output files, including visualizations and statistical test results.
Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, we perform a visual and statistical exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of key metrics across different groups.

Hypothesis Testing
We formulate and test the following hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference between the control and experimental groups.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference between the control and experimental groups.
Appropriate statistical tests are used based on the nature of the data to determine the validity of these hypotheses.

Conclusion
Based on the analysis, we draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the changes implemented on the E-news Express platform.

Recommendations
If the results indicate a significant improvement in the experimental group, we recommend rolling out the changes to the entire user base. Detailed business recommendations are provided based on the statistical findings.

Installation
